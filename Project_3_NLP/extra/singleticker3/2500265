            <p>Last month, I discussed how technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/msft" title="Microsoft Corporation">MSFT</a>) was due <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2430505-microsoft-time-for-a-dividend-raise">for a dividend raise</a>. The company's next dividend declaration was expected in mid-September. Microsoft in recent years has really increased its dividend, and investors were expecting another nice raise. Well on Tuesday night, the company did announce a raise. Today, I'll break down the raise, and where it leaves Microsoft's dividend in regards to peers.</p><h2 class="title">The announced raise:</h2><p>On Tuesday, the company announced some changes to its board of directors along with <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-announces-board-changes-quarterly-231500829.html" rel="nofollow">its annual dividend raise</a>. For those that remember my above mentioned article, my best guess was a raise to $0.31 or $0.32 per quarter. Well, here's what Microsoft stated:</p><blockquote class="quote"><p>Microsoft also announced its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, reflecting a 3-cent, or 11%, increase over the previous quarter's dividend. The dividend is payable Dec. 11, 2014, to shareholders of record on Nov. 20, 2014. The ex-dividend date will be Nov. 18, 2014.</p><p>"As we continue to focus on the company's transformation and the board continues to evaluate capital strategy options, this dividend increase is another step in our ongoing commitment to increase capital returns to shareholders," said Amy Hood, chief financial officer of Microsoft.</p></blockquote><p>My original prediction was for $0.32, but I lowered my guess in August due to large cap technology names favoring buybacks instead of dividends. Intel (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/intc" title="Intel Corporation">INTC</a>) and Apple (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/aapl" title="Apple Inc.">AAPL</a>) are two names that have definitely focused on buybacks in 2014 at the cost of dividend raises. I'm glad that I lowered my prediction, because Microsoft came in at $0.31 per quarter, or $1.24 on an annual basis. In the chart below, you can see a recent dividend history. To see all of the company's dividend history, click <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/investor/Stock/StockSplit/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Since the majority of the $0.31 quarterly rate will be paid in 2015, I've given the $0.31 rate the "2015" year in the chart.</p><p><img src="http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/16/1017993-14109166758347905-Bill-Maurer.jpg" hspace="6" vspace="6"></p><p>*According to Microsoft's dividend history, the first payment in fiscal 2006 was $0.08, before being raised to $0.09 for the final three payments. The chart above uses the $0.09 figure for fiscal 2006.</p><p>As stated in my summary above, this was the fifth straight yearly raise in double digits, percentage wise. This is actually the ninth dividend raise in a row that was a double-digit raise, but the company did have the one year without a raise, so the nine raises are not consecutive in terms of years. Microsoft's dividend has grown nicely in recent years.</p><h2 class="title">Comparisons to peers:</h2><p>In an article published <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2494095-intel-no-dividend-raise-until-at-least-2015">earlier this week</a>, I detailed how Microsoft could jump Intel with a big enough raise. Intel has not raised its dividend in a couple of years, allowing Microsoft to catch up a bit. In the chart below, I've compared Microsoft against some other large cap technology dividend payers, including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/csco" title="Cisco Systems, Inc.">CSCO</a>) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/qcom" title="Qualcomm Inc.">QCOM</a>).</p><p><img src="http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/16/1017993-14109166843986814-Bill-Maurer.jpg" hspace="6" vspace="6"></p><p>Although some may have been hoping for a larger raise, Microsoft did in fact pass Intel for second place in terms of annual yield. Microsoft's yield as of Tuesday's close stood at 2.65%, which is about seven basis points ahead of Intel. Cisco remains the leader with a yield just over 3.00%. Unless we see a sizable raise from one of these names or a huge drop in stock price, I don't see anyone challenging Cisco for the lead anytime soon.</p><h2 class="title">Final thoughts:</h2><p>Microsoft raised its quarterly dividend by three cents on Tuesday. While some investors may have been hoping for a little more, this is a solid raise of more than 10%. Microsoft's dividend yield is back up to 2.65%, putting it in second place when compared to large cap tech peers. Investors should be satisfied with the latest dividend news out of Microsoft.</p>
