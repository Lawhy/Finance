            <p>Gap Inc. (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gps" title="The Gap, Inc.">GPS</a>) is a global organization that operates in the US, Europe, Canada and Asia wherein more than 75% of the revenues are attributable to the US region as per the recent quarter's report. The remaining regions are significant in terms of maintain the geographical presence of the company; however, their contribution to the top line remains under 10%. Gap distributes apparel, accessories, and other products for individuals of all age groups and both genders under the segments Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. The contribution to total revenue by each segment is shown in the pie chart below.</p><p><img src="http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/17940942_14108670063680_rId5.png"></p><p>Source: <a href="http://investors.gapinc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111302&amp;p=irol-sec" rel="nofollow">Second Quarter Earnings, FY2014</a></p><h2 class="title">Recent Performance</h2><p>The company's comparable sales have remained dismal since the start of fiscal year 2014 compared to the monthly sales recorded last year. As of August, comps declined by <a href="http://www.gapinc.com/content/attachments/gapinc/Comp-Sales/comp_sales_doc2014.pdf" rel="nofollow">2%</a> as opposed to a 2% hike in the same month last year; analysts had their expectations set at a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-04/gap-falls-after-august-same-store-sales-trail-estimates.html?cmpid=yhoo" rel="nofollow">1.7%</a> gain. Both the Gap Global and Banana Republic Global segments indicated a negative sales performance while Old Navy Global's sales increased by 2% compared to the figure reported August of FY2013. Gap Global's monthly comparable sales have remained negative since the start of the year while Banana Republic showed fluctuating performance during this period. That being said, the company's Gap Global segment is anticipated to put a downward pressure on the aggregate margins of the company since the segment has lost popularity. This is evident in the recent sales performance of the segment wherein the segment's sales declined 5.6% more than the analysts' expectations. The Old Navy segment fell short of the analysts' estimates by 1.6% while Banana Republic fell by 0.9%.</p><p>Over the past few quarters the company's sales have shown a wide array of fluctuation with a 15% QoQ hike in the top line recorded at the end of the fourth quarter of FY2013 followed by a 17% QoQ plunge in the next quarter. As per the recent earnings report 5% QoQ while a 3% YoY increase was seen in the top line. However, the end of year performance will remain constricted in my opinion since the company's major segment is faltering even though the US remains the major contributor to the top line.</p><h2 class="title">Market Expansion</h2><p>Due to the faltering sales in the US region, the company is looking forward to expanding its penetration of the Asian markets which presently account for only 9% of the total revenues of the company, in order to lessen its dependency on the sales generated from the US.</p><p>It is an established fact that Asia is a developing and high growth market; this is also evident by the company's sales which show <a href="http://www.gapinc.com/content/attachments/gapinc/GPSEarnings/Historical%20sales%20by%20division.pdf" rel="nofollow">11.25% YoY</a> growth in terms of comps in this region. According to recent news the company will open <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/21/us-gap-results-idUSKBN0GL22P20140821?type=companyNews" rel="nofollow">40</a> new stores in India by partnering with Arvind Lifestyle Brand Ltd which operates more than 1,000 retail outlets in India. Gap will roll out its stores by spring of next year, meaning that a significant boost in the company's top and bottom line should be expected.</p><p>India's apparel market is rapidly growing; the country's apparel market stood was worth $40 billion in 2011 and is expected to reach <a href="http://www.citiindia.com/pdf/Harminder%20Sahni.pdf" rel="nofollow">$120 billion</a> by 2020 which reflects a cumulative growth of approximately 15% per year. The urban population of the country reached about <a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/urban-population-in-india-jumps-to-31-/991619/" rel="nofollow">31%</a>, as per a 2012 estimate so the demand for branded products is increasing especially among women who now look forward to adding western clothing to their wardrobes. It is further estimated that <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/03e3e5ac-2940-11e4-9d5d-00144feabdc0.html" rel="nofollow">50%</a> of India's 1.2 billion population is under 25 years of age and that branded products are expected to comprise 35% of the total retail sales in India by 2020 compared to just 25% of sales attributable to brands in 2011. These facts mean that the target market for Gap exists in India with growing prospects; however, it is difficult to determine the actual financial impact of the new stores in India on the bottom line of the company since the market is rather new for Gap. Still, it is expected that the geographical expansion will add value since India is a high-growth market with high brand awareness and an increasing urban population.</p><h2 class="title">Valuation</h2><p>Although the exact financial impact of the new stores is difficult to estimate, I have completed a multiples-based valuation in order to understand the overall upward price potential in the company's stock. The model indicates that there exists approximately 16% upward price potential.</p><p>I have allotted varying weights to different price multiples based on their relationship to the company's financials. Since P/E ratios and cash flows have a more direct relationship to the overall financial performance of the company they have been given a higher weight. On the other hand, the P/B and P/S ratios have been given lower weight since book value is a historical figure while revenues are just a starting point to assess the financial performance of any company.</p><p><img src="http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/17940942_14108670063680_rId14.png"></p><p>Source: <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=GPS+Key+Statistics" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Finance</a>; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/financialHighlights?symbol=GPS" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>; <a href="http://financials.morningstar.com/income-statement/is.html?t=GPS&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US" rel="nofollow">Morningstar</a></p><h2 class="title">Concluding Remarks</h2><p>The current weakness in price creates a buying opportunity for investors. Although the sales are currently weak, significant strength in the top and bottom lines is expected as the sales from high growth markets become evident. The multiples-based valuation also suggests upward movement in the company's stock price.</p>
