            <p>This is the fourth article of my new Question and Answer series that I'll be doing. The goal of this series is to provide real investors with a clean, short, understandable and to the point article that answers their core question.</p><p>Today, I'll be answering a question I received a few days ago:</p><p><em>What are your thoughts on Awilco Drilling Ltd</em> (OTCPK:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/awlcf" title="Awilco Driling Ltd.">AWLCF</a>)<em>, the stock tanked after its latest dividend and I don't know what to do?</em></p><p><img src="http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/16/saupload_abfcf8b966ab731a026c0ce41f3aacff.png" alt="AWLCF Chart"></p><p class="yc_font"><a href="http://ycharts.com/companies/AWLCF" dofollow="true">AWLCF</a> data by <a href="http://ycharts.com" dofollow="true">YCharts</a></p><p><strong>Well, the recent 34% decline is not attributable to one specific event</strong><strong>, in my opinion</strong><strong>. Instead, investors seemed to be worrying about multiple factors at once:</strong></p><p>1). The company's 100% dependency on its two rigs: Any temporary cessation or closure of the rigs would have a negative impact on Awilco's bottom line.</p><p>2). The fact that management seems to be looking for new growth opportunities (which will lower their dependency but will require extra capital =&gt; so a possible decrease in dividend).</p><p>3). The company's exposure to lower oil prices.</p><p>4). The fact that major shareholders are selling shares.</p><p>5). Increasing operating expenses.</p><h2 class="title">Let me address them one by one.</h2><p>First, while I agree that the stock deserves to quote against lower valuation multiples that take the dependency on the two rigs into account, I feel that Awilco's current market cap of $504 million is ridiculously low compared to its fiscal 2013 net profit of $122 million, indicating a P/E ratio of 4.13. So the risks considering the company's dependency on the two rigs have been largely taken into account.</p><p>Secondly, I wouldn't mind a temporary decline in dividend if management decides to expand and differentiate its activities. This will have a (temporary) negative impact on its dividend, but will be much better/healthier and safer for shareholders in the future. Management also stressed that it will always try to distribute a substantial dividend. So a complete cut to $0 will not occur anytime soon.</p><p>In a worst-case scenario where Awilco's dividend gets cut in half from $4.6 to $2.3 per year, the stock would still yield 13.5% at current levels.</p><p>Further, Awilco's negative exposure to lower oil prices is quite limited as it is having one rig doing well abandonment work, which has nothing to do with oil prices whatsoever.</p><p>There have also been concerns about some selling of big investors, which helped to push the stock down. Combined, almost 2 million shares of Awilco were sold by Awilhelmsen (Awilco's largest shareholder) and QVT Financial LP. However, after the trade, both companies still represent 53 percent of the registered share capital and are inclined to remain long-term industrial owners of Awilco Drilling.</p><p>And last but not least, there might be some concern about Awilco's per day operating expenses that rose from $80,120 during Q1 2014 to $94,572 during Q2. This seems quite a bad evolution, but was mainly caused by social services taxes for offshore workers that were imposed.</p><p><strong>Briefly put:</strong> None of the above-mentioned concerns seem to explain or justify the steep 34% share price decline.</p><p>On top of this, Awilco's rigs have been seeing higher day rates, which will boost next quarter figures.</p><p>Awilco's WilPhoenix has enjoyed a premium rate of $442,500 for June, July and August vs. the prior rate with Premier of $322,000, so the next quarterly report will include 2 months of that $442,500 rate and one month of the new $387,500 rate with Apache (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/apa" title="Apache Corporation">APA</a>), which will run through at least mid-2017. Both of those rates are nicely above the $322,000 rate the rig was making through May.</p><p>WilHunter went from $360,000 per day to $385,000 per day on June 1, and that rate stays at the higher level through November 30, 2015 when the WilHunter yard stay begins.</p><h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2><p>As I'm not able to find any real reason for the 34% drop, I'm inclined to be very bullish on this stock despite the above-average risk profile. A P/E ratio of 9 would indicate a share price above $36, giving the stock an upside potential of over 100%. The company's "problems" aren't really as problematic as they seem. The dividend is likely to stay intact or will decline slightly during 2015-2016 when the rigs get their one-month regular service, but even if the dividend gets cut in half (don't get me wrong: this is a highly unlikely scenario), the stock would yield over 13%. Insiders sold 2 million shares but still own 14 million shares, and will continue to hold them. They just trimmed their positions a bit. Awilco's other shareholders continue to be big and experienced equity companies like Citibank (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/c" title="Citigroup Inc.">C</a>), Merrill Lynch, UBS (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ubs" title="UBS Group AG">UBS</a>), JPMorgan (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/jpm" title="JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.">JPM</a>), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/db" title="Deutsche Bank AG">DB</a>) and Goldman (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/gs" title="Goldman Sachs Group Inc.">GS</a>), which also boosts my confidence about the stock. At current prices, <span>Awilco</span> is a big BUY in my book. And I certainly don't see a reason to sell.</p>
