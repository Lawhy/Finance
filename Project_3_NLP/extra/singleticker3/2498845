            <p>The verdict is in. BP Plc has been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bps-gross-negligence-caused-gulf-oil-spill-federal-judge-rules/2014/09/04/3e2b9452-3445-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea_story.html" rel="nofollow">charged with gross negligence</a> with regards to the biggest offshore oil spill in American history. District Judge Carl Barbier who held the trains sans jury has given his verdict against BP for the <a href="http://ocean.si.edu/gulf-oil-spill" rel="nofollow">2010 Gulf of Mexico spill</a>, which killed 11 and spewed oil in waters that were in contact with five different states. Four million barrels of oil - three months worth of supply - was criminally wasted.</p><p>The company might have to pay up to $4,300 per wasted barrel, which sums up to be over $17 billion. BP's claims of being merely "negligent" and allegations that other parties were equally culpable have been resoundingly dismissed by David Uhlmann (who led the Justice Department's Environmental Crimes Section for seven years, and is currently professor and director of the Environmental Law and Policy Program at the University of Michigan Law School.) So after four years of deliberation on who was at fault for the Gulf of Mexico disaster, BP has finally been charged guilty.</p><p>BP has spent $28 billion already in the aftermath of the accident, and fell nearly 6% at the day's close in London, on September 4, the day the verdict was announced. This is the biggest plunge for BP in over four years.</p><h2 class="title">Partners in Crime</h2><p>While BP was charged as reckless, its <a href="http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/BP-Halliburton-and-Transocean-Found-Negligent-in-Deepwater-Horizon-Spill.html" rel="nofollow">co-defendants Transocean Ltd. and Halliburton</a> both got away with charges of negligence. On the day of the verdict Transocean slid 1 percent to $37.76, while Halliburton saw a 1.5% fall, with the stock closing at $66.55.</p><p>BP has reacted to the verdict by saying that it "strongly disagrees" with the ruling and the company would appeal immediately. The company has claimed that allegations of gross negligence with regards to the accident are not backed by evidence.</p><p>The verdict has further aggravated its woes at a time where crude resource hunt has been riskier, and hence more expensive. The company has been selling its assets left, right and centre, ranging from Ohio to Pakistan, which has continuously shrunk the company, as it continues to pay for the 2010 disaster. This has halted BP's deep-water drilling plays for months.</p><p>67% of the spill's responsibility now lies with BP, with Transocean being 30% responsible, according to Barbier. Halliburton got away with merely 3% of the blame. A few days before the announcement, Halliburton had announced its intention of settling the majority of the lawsuits regarding the spill, which would <a href="https://www.energylivenews.com/2014/09/15/halliburton-agrees-1-1bn-gulf-oil-spill-settlement/" rel="nofollow">cost the company around $1.1 billion</a>.</p><h2 class="title">Asset Sales, Debt</h2><p>BP has fallen 26 percent since the oil spill four years ago, which saw the then CEO Tony Hayward sacked, and a halt in dividends. During the same period, ExxonMobil (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/xom" title="Exxon Mobil Corporation">XOM</a>) and Royal Dutch Shell (<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rds.a" title="Royal Dutch Shell plc">RDS.A</a>, <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rds.b" title="Royal Dutch Shell plc">RDS.B</a>) have witnessed hikes of 44% and 34% respectively.</p><p>Hayward's replacement, Robert Dudley has been working on <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4e319a88-4074-11e3-ae19-00144feabdc0.html" rel="nofollow">asset sale campaigning</a> to raise funds to streamline BP. These sales include BP's natural gas maneuvers in Vietnam, and refineries from California and Texas.</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/business/international/bps-earnings-fall-as-it-continues-to-sell-assets.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow">BP has put aside $43 billion</a> for fines and cleanup costs, with around $28 billion being hoarded for the payment of potential costs. The company is vying to make sure that it lifts the burden off the shoulders, while simultaneously making up to its shareholders by reducing debt and buying back stock.</p><p>Even before the fines regarding pollution, BP was much worse off in terms of debt than any of its competitors. Its debt-to-earnings before adding interest, depreciation of tax and amortization is 1.67, while Shell's corresponding number is 0.9 and Exxon is even better off at 0.39.</p><p>The apprehension of the investors is understandable considering that BP's dividend yield of 4.8% is greater than Shell (4.6%), Chevron (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cvx" title="Chevron Corporation">CVX</a>) (3.1%) and Exxon (2.6%).</p><h2 class="title">Potential Liabilities</h2><p>There are three aspects that would define the company's liabilities, <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/environment/managing-our-impact-on-the-environment/complying-with-regulations/clean-water-act-provision.html" rel="nofollow">according to the Clean Water Act</a>. The Act says that up to $1,100 per barrel is charged if it's a case of strict liability, which can go up to $4,300 per oil barrel for gross negligence. With the latter being the current verdict, the fine for BP would be over $17 billion, depending on the other aspects of the Clear Water Act.</p><p>In addition to the verdict, the amount of oil spilled and the barrel fines' size will help shape up the overall fine. January's testimony on the 8 penalty factors shaping up the fines would settle the overall fine for BP.</p><p>According to the company's estimates, 2.45 million barrels were spilled, but the U.S. Department of Energy believes the figure is somewhere around 4.2 million. BP has set aside $3.51 billion for the penalties, according to its own estimates of oil spill and the assumption that it wouldn't be deemed "grossly negligent." As things are panning out, those $3.51 billion should fall seriously short of the number that the company might eventually have to pay.</p><p>In case the current call stands and BP is charged with a $4,300 per barrel fine, the company would have to pay somewhere between $10-$18 billion, according to the verdict on the oil spill amount. This, in turn, would translate into liabilities worth $7-$14.5 billion. Once the tax is factored in, the liabilities on BP's valuation could rise to $11 billion, which could see a negative impact of $3.30 per share for BP.</p><p>These numbers clearly depict that while BP has had a tumultuous time since the oil spill in 2010, the company's pain is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/06/11/what-penalties-are-bp-and-anadarko-to-face-under-the-clean-water-act/" rel="nofollow">only going to get worse</a> with the September 4 verdict. The only hope that the company and its shareholders have is that BP's appeal against the "gross negligence" verdict might help reduce the overall penalty. As things stand, though, the company's own estimates fall significantly short of the actual fines that it may have to pay, which would be in excess of $17-$18 billion. This does not bode well for BP's investors at all.</p>
