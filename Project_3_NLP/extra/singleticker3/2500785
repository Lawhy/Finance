            <p>Kroger (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/kr" title="Kroger Co.">KR</a>) has been on a roll this year with its stock up by more than 33%. Although the economy has been pretty challenging in the last couple of years, still Kroger has managed a noteworthy performance.</p><p>In its recently-reported quarter, Kroger has generated revenue of $25.31 billion, an 11.6% increase versus last year and beat the analyst estimates of $24.9 billion. The Company reported its earnings at $347 million, 9.5% growth in its bottom line compared to last year.</p><p>Kroger has reported its 43rd consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales growth. The growth in comp sales can be reasoned to better service provided by the Company which created a great shopping experience by offering complete assortment and low prices.</p><h2 class="title">A Comparative Market Outlook</h2><p>The economy has been weak in the past half-decade, yet the Company was able to produce a stellar performance. As per the Conference Board, consumer confidence has increased to 90.9 in July from 86.4 in June and the Company seems to have been benefited by it. Further, it is noteworthy that Kroger has been able to achieve growth on its own strengths as is understood from the fact that during the same period, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/wmt" title="Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.">WMT</a>) reported a feeble sales growth of just .02%.</p><p>Another striking improvement is that Kroger has reported its TTM revenue of $103.88 billion on July 31, 2014, an increase of $5.33 billion over July 2013. In the same period, Wal-Mart had revised its TTM revenue to $480.48 billion, rising from $472.48 billion in July 2013. If we compare in terms of percentage, we can see how Kroger's TTM growth has bettered that of Wal-Mart's.</p><p>Kroger operates in an industry that is cyclical and does not provide very high margins. In the last ten years, Kroger has reported a net profit margin of 1.2%. The margins are in line with that of giants like Costco (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/cost" title="Costco Wholesale Corporation">COST</a>), whose net profit has averaged out at 1.8%, and Safeway's (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/swy" title="Safeway Inc.">SWY</a>), that stood at 1.1%.</p><p>The reasons for expecting an increase in profitability are: increase in spending on food and other items as the economy improves which improves customers' spending power and they start becoming less sensitive about price. This is when Kroger can push in its high-margin products.</p><p>Although Kroger operates at a very low profit margin, it has generated a return of 19.9% on equity (ROE) in the last decade and more than 30% in the last two fiscal years. In the same period, Costco and Safeway have generated a return of 13.2% and 9.5%, respectively. Going forward as margins should improve, Kroger should be generating better returns for its investors.</p><h2 class="title">Acquisitions Are Delivering</h2><p>In its second quarter, Kroger has included the revenue from its recent acquisition of Harris Teeter which has also boosted its revenue. Harris Teeter is a very reputed brand in the growing Southeastern US markets and this is the reason why Kroger is retaining the brand name. Moreover, Harris Teeter's stores are located in areas with high income generating residents, which gives Kroger a direct access to such customers.</p><p>Going forward, if we add the benefits of economies of scale, we have additional capital and strong management support of Kroger coupled with Harris Teeter's current operational capacity; the acquired Company's future looks bright. Kroger's merger with Harris Teeter is also positive, as the culture in both the companies is identical, which is expected to add a synergy of $40 million-$50 million a year.</p><p>Kroger has also announced another acquisition of <strong>Vitacost.com</strong> (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/vitc" title="Vitacost.com, Inc.">VITC</a>), an online retailer of healthy living products. Vitacost operates across all 50 states in the U.S., including those 16 states where Kroger still does not have its reach. Kroger's management also expects the deal to enhance the sale of its own Simple Truth organic product line. Kroger should be able to increase its digital capabilities, thereby improving the Company's omni-channel in the core grocery business from the acquisition. Vitacost's acquisition by Kroger will be advantageous as it should help in tapping a fast-growing health product market, as people are turning more health-conscious.</p><h2 class="title">Going Forward</h2><p>In the future, Kroger is all set to benefit as the number of customers buying organic products is on the rise. As the Company CEO McMullen said, "It (organic food) would be well over half our customers. That continues to increase."</p><p>Increase in sale of the organic category is beneficial for Kroger in a number of ways. Firstly, as the people are turning more health conscious, the comparable-store sales growth is more compared to that for rest of the store. In this quarter itself, Kroger's organic store brand grew at a double digit pace. Secondly, organic products command higher margins and this is going to further help the Company's margins.</p><p>Another important positive sign about Kroger is that it is planning to hire 20,000 new employees across the nation, as its growth trajectory has created more employment opportunities.</p><p>Due to some positive developments in the second quarter, Kroger's management has now revised its adjusted earnings to $3.22-$3.28 per share, an improvement from the previous guidance of $3.19 to $3.27 per share. Analysts projects Kroger's earnings to be as high as $3.28 per share this year. Further, identical store sales growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.25%, compared to previous expectation of 3 to 4%.</p><h2 class="title">Takeaway</h2><p>Kroger's performance in the past has been exquisite, with its comp sales increasing in the last 43 consecutive quarters. The Company is well equipped to fire all guns and in a position to grow both organically and inorganically (mergers and acquisitions). Further, as the customers in general are becoming health conscious, a step towards organic and health related products should be helpful. The forward P/E is valued at 14 times, signifying strong growth prospects in the future making the Company a safe bet in the long run.</p>
