            <p>As VIP gaming in Macau decreases, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/wynn" title="Wynn Resorts, Limited">WYNN</a>) has recorded a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/09/09/how-will-lower-casino-revenues-in-macau-impact-wynn-resorts/" rel="nofollow">10%</a> decline in its share prices over the past one month. Although the region is recording an 8% growth in gaming relative to last year, gaming has witnessed an overall decline over the past few months.</p><h2 class="title">Gaming in Macau</h2><p>Wynn Resorts has one operational casino in Macau at the moment, but development for another in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303916904577378943556251210" rel="nofollow">Cotai, worth $4 billion</a>, has already begun. This resort will be operational by 2016, and will contribute significantly to the market share of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Gaming's rise in popularity in Macau over the past few years, brought rewards for Wynn Resorts as well. Turnover increased by 94%, between 2007 and 2013, increasing from $6.6 billion to a staggering $123 billion, during that period - a significant increase. In 2013, however, casinos contributed only 3% or almost $3.5 billion to the overall gaming turnover.</p><h2 class="title">Why is VIP gaming declining?</h2><p>There are several reasons that have led to a decline in VIP gaming in the region. Since early June, an increase in sports betting was noted, which has led to a reduction in gambling in the region. The second quarter of the year experienced a larger decline in VIP gaming due to the FIFA world Cup that took place this year. Table revenues saw declines of <a href="http://www.scmp.com/business/money/article/1544523/macau-casinos-feel-heat-world-cup-fever-gamblers-bet-elsewhere" rel="nofollow">HK$801 million to HK$775 million per day</a> after the World Cup kicked off. For the first time in five years, casino's located in Macau noted a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-01/macau-casino-revenue-drops-3-7-first-decline-in-5-years.html" rel="nofollow">3.7%</a> decline in their revenues as well, and revenues recorded in the month of June amounted to $3.4 billion.</p><p>In addition to that, the government of China is leading an anti-corruption agenda which makes casinos and other gaming arenas subject to crackdowns. Due to this, revenues fell by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/01/us-macau-gambling-revenues-idUSKBN0G134G20140801" rel="nofollow">3.6% in July</a> and decelerated further by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/01/macau-gambling-results-idUSL3N0R221M20140901" rel="nofollow">6% in August</a>. There have been several arrests of high profile Chinese officials that have made the headlines and this seems to be causing a dent in the casino business in Macau. According to the Chinese government, almost <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2014-08/14/content_33240418.htm" rel="nofollow">84,000 individuals</a> have been 'disciplined' since January 1.</p><p>The month of July saw <a href="http://calvinayre.com/2014/06/18/casino/macau-transit-visa-restrictions-unionpay-cheats/" rel="nofollow">visa transit restrictions</a> being imposed which further caused gaming to decline. These restrictions include shortening the duration for which travelers can stay in Macau. Heavy penalties are imposed for non-compliance. This is also expected to lead to a decrease in VIP gaming for the rest of the year.</p><h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2><p>With Macau being the only region in China where gambling is being legalized, the restrictions that are being imposed by the government will lead to a decline in the top and bottom lines of casino businesses located in Macau. Wynn Resorts is one of the companies that could suffer from this drop in revenue, and share prices are expected to decline owing to the decreasing demand, especially if businesses cannot rebound this year.</p><p>Though this is bad news for the company in the short run, better results are expected in the future. China is an emerging market that has a growing number of high net worth individuals in its population. The country has almost <a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-CM-AWAMS-POV-High-Net-Worth-China-Final-Oct-2012.pdf" rel="nofollow">1.3 million</a> high net worth individuals at the moment, who have a combined total of <a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-CM-AWAMS-POV-High-Net-Worth-China-Final-Oct-2012.pdf" rel="nofollow">$4.3 trillion</a> in wealth. This number is expected to increase in the years to come, which will lead to a boost in demand for VIP gaming. In addition to that, Wynn Resorts is also developing another casino in Cotai, which is expected to begin operations from 2016. This new casino will not only add to revenues of the company, but could also lead to an increase the company's share in the Chinese market share. Therefore, share prices are most likely going to increase in the future, based on higher revenues and a business expansion.</p><p>For now, due to the hostilities in the gaming environment in China, share prices could suffer in the short run which does not encourage buying of shares at the moment for those who seek to make immediate gains. However, these share prices are expected to recover in the years to come as an increase in demand and operations is expected, therefore, buying of shares could take place after this year and the announcement of the latest financial results for they might bring good news for investors.</p><p>This expectation is backed by the news that <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-bank-sees-2015-turnaround-155054216.html" rel="nofollow">Deutsche Bank</a> has also maintained a 'buy' rating for the stock as well. According to Carlo Santarelli, growth is expected in 2015, but he has stated that gaming revenue in Macau is expected to grow by 7.2% in the next year, down from 11.5%. Although a recovery is expected in the next year, this year remains a challenge that Wynn Resorts will have to fight through.</p>
