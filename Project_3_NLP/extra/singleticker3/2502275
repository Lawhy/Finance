Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we look at what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.</p> <p>The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and thirty trading day time frame:</p> <p><em>(click to enlarge)</em><a href="http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/17/731864-14109779778732207-WhisperNumber_origin.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/17/731864-14109779778732207-WhisperNumber.jpg" hspace="6" vspace="6"></a></p> <p>The strongest price movement of +1.2% comes within twenty trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -1.0% within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number.

We call these earnings expectations whisper numbers. Our whisper numbers are gained from individual investors and traders just like you that have registered with our site. WhisperNumber is completely open and free for anyone to contribute. While the whisper number itself is an important part of our analysis, a company's 'price reaction' to beating or missing the whisper number expectation is the key. On average, companies that exceed the whisper are 'rewarded', while companies that miss are 'punished' following an earnings report. Trading on whispers is a technical play on market psychology, rather than a bet on a company's fundamental strengths.
