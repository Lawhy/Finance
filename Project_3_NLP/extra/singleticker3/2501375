            <p>Recently BlackBerry's (NASDAQ:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/bbry" title="BlackBerry Ltd.">BBRY</a>) enterprise head John Sims said that the company has been experimenting with wearables, <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2468347,00.asp" rel="nofollow">reported PCMag</a>. "I would love BBM to be running on a wearable," he said. "We're not releasing anything at the moment, but it's definitely an area of research for us." Computerworld <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2605995/blackberrys-researching-a-smartwatch-too.html" rel="nofollow">reported</a> that the wearables research at BlackBerry includes smartwatches and even smartglasses.</p><p>Sandeep Chennakeshu, a former BlackBerry technology consultant, recently joined the company as president of technology solutions. Chennakeshu said that BlackBerry's initiatives in elliptical curve cryptography to improve secure key efficiency will be very useful for the Internet of Things, or IoT, for which BlackBerry is building an infrastructure that can collect data used in workplace applications such as truck fleet tracking.</p><p>BlackBerry's venture into wearables is not entirely unexpected to us as we already shared in our <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2386765-why-blackberrys-mobile-health-ambition-is-positive-for-investors">original article</a> that BlackBerry is looking to enter the mHealth arena with its subsidiary QNX Software Systems. QNX will launch a new OS just for medical devices. Apart from mHealth, BlackBerry continues to work with its QNX operating system and is "moving into new areas" that include infotainment in telematics used in vehicles, Chennakeshu said. Close to 100 million wearable RPM (remote patient monitoring) devices will be shipped over the next five years, according to <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140904005799/en/Foundations-Emerge-Revolution-Remote-Patient-Monitoring-ABI#.VBmHQBanvIX" rel="nofollow">ABI Research</a>. We're optimistic on BlackBerry's venture into the wearables market.</p><p><b>Business relationship disclosure:</b> The update has been written by a BB Research stock analyst.
