            <p>Today, I awoke to the news of Sony (NYSE:<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/sne" title="Sony Corporation">SNE</a>) taking a major impairment charge in its Mobile Communications (MC) segment. The company announced that it would record an impairment charge of approximately ¥180 billion that would eliminate the entire amount of goodwill in the MC segment as well as widen the forecasted loss for FY15 to ¥230 billion (~ $2 billion). Furthermore, Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai said that the company will not pay a dividend for the first time in 56 years and intends to cut staff in its MC business by 15% (1000 people).</p><p>How does this affect my turnaround thesis? It does not. After digesting the news and the 10% pre-market drop, it becomes clear that the move is rational and perhaps even smart.</p><p>Hirai has previously announced that 2014 will be the year Sony completes its restructuring efforts. It has long been evident that Sony's MC business is not as valuable as stated on the books, and the market has been expecting a sizable impairment charge to reflect actual fair value of the business. Therefore, when an impairment charge was inevitable, it seems rational and smart to place it in a year that is already messy, so next year's results will not be tainted by miscellaneous charges.</p><p>Following the news, Hirai stated that Sony intends to reduce offering of mid-range models and concentrate on premium models such as the new Xperia Z3. In my opinion, this is good news as the Q1 statement clearly showed that the MC segment continues to struggle and is traveling down the same path as the PC segment did; competing in a commoditized environment (low- to mid-range models). The change in strategy makes the segment follow the overall strategy of focusing on premium offerings, which are the future business model, as described in my <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2310605-sony-is-reinventing-itself-a-turnaround-for-the-contrarian-investor">original article</a>.</p><p>Although the share is taking a beating today, I consider the overall turnaround thesis intact. The restructuring's short-term noise and messiness is by far outshone by Sony's long-term prospects. Therefore, I consider this momentary weakness a buying opportunity as the company's true potential will be unlocked in 2015.</p>
